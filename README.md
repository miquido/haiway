**Modern Python framework for functional programming with structured concurrency**

Haiway brings functional programming principles to Python's async ecosystem, providing a robust foundation for building scalable, maintainable applications with immutable state management and automatic resource cleanup.

## Why Haiway?

Building concurrent Python applications often involves complex state management, dependency injection frameworks, and careful resource handling. Haiway simplifies these challenges through:

### üîí **Immutability First**
Type-safe data structures that prevent race conditions and ensure predictable behavior in concurrent environments

### ‚ö° **Zero-Config DI**
Context-based dependency injection without decorators, containers, or complex frameworks

### üéØ **Functional Design**
Pure functions and explicit data flow make code easier to understand, test, and maintain

### üîÑ **Structured Concurrency**
Automatic task lifecycle management with guaranteed cleanup, even in error cases

## Core Principles

### üéØ **Type Safety Throughout**
Full type checking with modern Python features - unions, generics, protocols. Runtime validation ensures data integrity.

### üß© **Composable Building Blocks**
Small, focused components that combine into larger systems. No framework lock-in or magic.

### üîÑ **Explicit Over Implicit**
Dependencies are visible in type signatures. No hidden global state or surprising side effects.

### üé≠ **Async-Native**
Built for Python's async/await from the ground up. Includes utilities for retries, timeouts, and concurrent operations.

## üñ•Ô∏è Install

With pip:

```bash
pip install haiway
```
