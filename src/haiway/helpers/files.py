class FileAccess(State):
    """
    State container for file access configuration within a context scope.

    Provides the entry point for file operations within Haiway's context system.
    Follows the framework's pattern of using state classes to configure behavior
    that can be injected and replaced for testing.

    File access is scoped to the context, meaning only one file can be open
    at a time within a given context scope. This design ensures predictable
    resource usage and simplifies error handling.

    The default implementation provides standard filesystem access with
    optional file creation and exclusive locking. Custom implementations
    can be injected by replacing the accessing function.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic file operations:

    >>> async with ctx.scope("app", disposables=(FileAccess.open("config.json", create=True),)):
    ...     data = await File.read()
    ...     await File.write(b'{"setting": "value"}')

    Exclusive file access for critical operations:

    >>> async with ctx.scope("app", disposables=(FileAccess.open("config.json", exclusive=True),)):
    ...     content = await File.read()
    ...     processed = process_data(content)

        Open a file for reading and writing.

        Opens a file using the configured file access implementation. The file
        is opened with read and write permissions, and the entire file content
